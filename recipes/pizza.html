    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus 2 tsp to drizzle</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>250g pack lamb mince 10% fat</li>
        <li>1 red pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>½ tsp crushed chillies</li>
        <li>2 x 280g packs ready-rolled pizza dough</li>
        <li>½ x 390g carton Italian chopped tomatoes with olive oil and garlic</li>
        <li>100g reduced-fat salad cheese, crumbled</li>
        <li>15g fresh mint leaves, picked</li>
        <li>salad leaves, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to gas 7, 220°C, fan 200°C. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tbsp oil over a medium heat and add the onion and garlic. Gently fry for 5-8 mins until softened. Add the lamb mince and pepper and fry for 3-4 mins until browning. Pour off and discard the excess liquid and fat from the mince, then add the spices and fry for 2-3 mins until fragrant. Set aside</li>

        <li>Unroll the pizza dough and place each one on a baking sheet. Spread half the chopped tomatoes over each base, leaving a 2cm border. Top with the lamb mix and cheese, and drizzle each with 1 tsp oil. Bake the pizzas for 10-15 mins until golden. Scatter with mint leaves and serve half a pizza each with salad leaves, if you like.</li>

        <p><em>Get ahead:</em>You can prepare the mince mixture up to 24 hrs ahead; cool and keep covered in the fridge. It will also freeze for 1 month</p>
