    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A spicy tomato fish curry with mustard seeds, chilli and turmeric that is a classic recipe from Kerala, </li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp yellow mustard seeds</li>
        <li>150g onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>10 dried curry leaves, roughly crushed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garlic and ginger paste</li>
        <li>3 heaped tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>500g pack frozen hake fillets</li>
        <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
        <li>pinch of sugar​</li>
        <li>15g fresh coriander, roughly chopped, to garnish</li>
        <li>cooked basmati rice, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the chilli powder, ground coriander and turmeric in a small bowl. Mix with 2 tbsp water to form a paste; set aside.</li>

        <li>Heat the oil in a large, heavy- bottomed saucepan over a medium heat. Add the mustard seeds; when they begin to crackle, add the onions. Fry for 6 mins to soften. Add the curry leaves and garlic & ginger paste. Fry for 1 min, then add the tomato purée. Fry for 6 mins, stirring well. Add the spice paste and fry for 1 min. Add 400ml water and season to taste. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low. Add the fish, cover and simmer for 10 mins. Stir gently halfway through – try to keep the fsh intact.</li>

        <li>Remove from the heat and halve each piece of fish with the spoon. Add the lime juice, sugar and fresh coriander. Serve with rice, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
